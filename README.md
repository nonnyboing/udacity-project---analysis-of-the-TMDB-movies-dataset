# ANALYSIS OF THE TMDB MOVIES DATABASE
## by Nonso Ukwuma


## Dataset

This is an analysis of the TMDB movies data set which contains information about various movies stored in the movie database (TMDB). This data set contains data on over 10,000 movies including the user ratings, year and date of release, name of director, cast, runtime, budget and revenue generated from the movies. I will be reviewing the factors that affect profitability of movies and the percentage of the movies stored in the database that were profitable. This analysis was done using Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy and Seaborn.


## Summary of Findings

The analysis showed that features such as revenue and popularity had a positive impact on the profitability of movies. I also discovered that only 52% of all the recorded movies generated revenues while 48% generated losses. Finally, Even though 52% of the movies generated revenues, only 41% of the movies made actual profit which indicates that 11% of the movies that generated revenue failed to make profit. This data shows that less than 50% of the movie productions resulted in profitable ventures.



## Key Insights for Presentation

My presentation will focus on identifying the percentage of all the movies recorded in the TMDB database that generated revenues and what percentage that eventuallly made profit while looking at how revenue, profitability correlate with profitability.
